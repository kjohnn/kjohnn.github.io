	<h2>How to Use</h2>
	<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
	<p>Launching the app will cause the main screen to appear as shown in Figure 1. It has a circle diagram with ratio error on the x-axis and phase angle error on the y-axis.
	And it has the zero burden and its error TextFields, the rated burden and its error TextFields on the bottom and the arbitrary burden TextFields and its error on the top.
	The error circle could be drawn using the instrument voltage transformer error data sheet that describes zero burden error and the rated burden error.
	These errors which consist of ratio error and phase angle error could be entered into TextFields below on the diagram.
	You can see a pointer which shows the location on the diagram with the burden error which can be typed in into the TextFields above on the main screen.
	You can move the pointer within the circle fan shape whose location means the ratio error and the phase angle error at the burden showed above on the main screen.</p>

	<h3 id="circle diagram">Circle Diagram</h3>
	<p>The circle diagram is a tool which can show the error of instrument VTs with the arbitrary burden connected to the secondary terminals.
		The center of the circle is calculated with the zero burden error. The circle is drawn from the start point calculated with the rated burden error to 90 degree clockwise.
		The arbitrary burden error must be within the circle fan shape.</p>

	<h3 id="zero burden error">Zero Burden Error</h3>
	<p>The zero burden error is the error of the instrument VT with secondary terminals open which is needed to draw the circle.
		The error which means the ratio error(whithin ±1.5 %) and the phase angle error(whithin ±30.0 minutes) could be changed.
		Click the ratio error TextField or the phase angle error TextField at the left bottom side of the main screen and you will get the screen like Figure 3. Type in the error in the TextField at the center of the main screen.</p>

	<h3 id="rated burden error">Rated Burden Error</h3>
	<p>The rated burden error is the error of the instrument VT with the secondary terminals connecting the rated burden. It is also required to draw the circle.
		The error which mean ratio error(whithin ±1.5 %) and phase angle error(whithin ±30.0 minutes) could be changed.
		Click the ratio error TextField or the phase angle error TextField at the right bottom side of the main screen and you will get the screen like Figure 3. Type in the error in the TextField at the center of the main screen.</p>

	<h3 id="rated burden">Rated Burden</h3>
	<p>The rated burden could be changed in the range of 0.01 VA to 999.99 VA.
		Click the rated burden TextField at the right bottom side of the main screen and you will get the screen like Figure 3. Type in the burdern in the TextField at the center of the main screen.</p>

	<h3 id="arbitrary burden">Arbitrary Burden</h3>
	<p>The arbitrary burden(0.01 VA to the rated burden) with the power factor(0.0 to 1.0) could be changed.
		Click the arbitrary burden TextField or its power factor TextField and you will get the screen like Figure 3. Type in the burdern or its power factor in the TextField at the center of the main screen.
		The arbitrary burden change could move the pointer within the circle fan shape whose location means the ratio error and the phase angle error.
		You could get the error of the instrument VT with the burden which is connected to the secondary terminals</p>

	<h3 id="pointer">Pointer</h3>
	<p>The pointer could be draged within the circle fan shape which is drawn whith the rated burden error and the zero burden error.
		The location of the pointer is the ratio error and the phase angle error. The drag of the pointer could change the burden and its power factor.
		You could get the burden and its power factor with the error of the instrument VT you would like.</p>
